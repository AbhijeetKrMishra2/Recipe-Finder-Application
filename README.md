# Recipe-Finder-Application

This is a  Recipe-Finder-Application app that allows users to search for meals using TheMeal API. Users can search for meals, view detailed information about a meal, and add meals to their favorites list. The app is built using vanilla JavaScript and styled using CSS.

# Features
Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend. The search results update as the user types, similar to Google's search suggestions.
Each search result has a favorite button that allows the user to add the meal to their favorites list.
Clicking on a search result opens a new page with more information about that meal.
The meal detail page shows the meal's name, photo, instructions, and other details.
The favorites page displays a list of all the favorite meals.
The favorites list is persistent and remains the same even after closing or refreshing the browser.
Each meal in the favorites list has a remove button to remove it from the list.
